\title{ozmaps: Australia Maps}
\description{
Maps of Australian coastline and administrative regions. Data 
 can be drawn or accessed directly as simple features objects. Includes
 simple functions for country or state maps of Australia and in-built data
 sets of administrative regions from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Layers
 include electoral divisions and local government areas, simplified from the
 original sources but with sufficient detail to allow mapping of a local 
 municipality.
