#' Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) map data
#'
#' These data sets are simplifications of the formal statistical areas
#' and regions published by the ABS in 2016.
#'
#' Each layer was read from the source file with 'sf' package and attributes were removed, leaving a single 'NAME'
#' column from the year-specific column names. The geometry has been
#' simplified using 'rmapshaper::ms_simplify' with default arguments (0.05 detail).
#'
#' Several layers are not included from the total available.
#'
#' The entire nation layer 'AUST' is not included
#' as it is the union of the State and Territory layer.
#'
#' Statistical Areas Level 1 is not included as it is very large (56Mb after simplification).
#'
#' The mesh blocks are not included, nor Greater Capital City Statistical Areas,
#' Indigenous Regions, Remoteness Structure, Statistical Areas (L2, L3, L4),
#' State Electoral Divisions. See 'ozmaps.data' for these.
